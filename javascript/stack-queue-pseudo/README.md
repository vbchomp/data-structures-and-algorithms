# Stacks Queue Pseudo

## Challenge

Implement a Queue using two Stacks. Start on branch stack-queue-pseudo.

## Approach & Efficiency

Started with the tests from the previous challenge. Continued using the methods described for TDD described in Youtube video to figure out how to start TDD. [Linked Lists Data Structure | JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBdE8DElQQU)

The previous code challenge test for enqueueing was modified to include two stacks. Then the stacks were pushed into the Pseudo Queue.

I keep getting an error with the expected and received values. It is expecting values from the second stack and getting values from the first stack. Not quite seeing where the error is happening, as I thought I was telling it to accept the second stack.

I have not written any other tests yet, as the first one is not running properly yet.
