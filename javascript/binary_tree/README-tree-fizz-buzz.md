# tree-fizz-buzz

## Challenge

Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree.

Set the values of each of the new nodes depending on the corresponding node value in the source tree. Use tree-fizz-buzz branch.

## Approach & Efficiency

Started with the tests listed in the challenge. Watched a Youtube video to figure out how to start TDD. [Linked Lists Data Structure | JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBdE8DElQQU)
