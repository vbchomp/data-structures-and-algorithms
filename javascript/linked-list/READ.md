Implementation: Singly Linked Lists
Specifications
Read all of these instructions carefully.
Name things exactly as described.
Do all your work in a your data-structures-and-algorithms public repository.
Create a new branch in your repo named as noted below.
Follow the language-specific instructions for the challenge type listed below.
Update the “Table of Contents” - in the README at the root of the repository - with a link to this challenge’s README file.
Challenge Setup & Execution
Branch Name: linked-list

Challenge Type: New Implementation

Features
Node
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Linked List
Create a Linked List class
Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
The class should contain the following methods
insert
Arguments: value
Returns: nothing
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
includes
Arguments: value
Returns: Boolean
Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
to string
Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.
Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).
Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
Can properly insert into the linked list
The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

Stretch Goal
Create a new branch called doubly-linked-list, and, using the resources available to you online, implement a doubly linked list (completely separate from your singly linked list).
