# Linked List Insertions

## Challenge Summary

Create a Node class with properties for the value stored in the Node and pointer for the next Node. Create a Linked List class with a get at the kth methods. Use branch name linked-list-kth.

## Approach & Efficiency

Watched a youtube video that explained how to insert at an index. I need to come back to the second guy and watch his TDD stuff.

## Solution

Honestly, I am not sure how to run the code. I could not figure out how to get it to run, so I hope it does a little.

What it was suppopsed to do was created a Node class, then created a Linked List class.

In the Node class, the next value is null so that when the last node is created, there is no pointer to data pointing to another node.

In the Linked Lists, it requires the node. Then creates the class with a null header and size of 0. The header is null so that there is no 'first' node. And the size is 0 to initilialize the index.
