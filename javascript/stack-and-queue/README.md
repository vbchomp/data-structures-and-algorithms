# Stacks and Queues

## Challenge

Use a Linked List, with tests to implement a Queue and Stack. Start on branch stack-and-queue.

## Approach & Efficiency

Sarted with the tests listed in the challenge. Watched a Youtube video to figure out how to start TDD. [Linked Lists Data Structure | JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBdE8DElQQU)

So I started with the queue tests. Made the tests match the challenge instructions to make it easier this time.

Then I created the Node class. The created the queue and stack classes.

I was able to get help on code from Ayrat and the class code reviews to get the methods in the queue.js working.

Not sure if the queue tests are right. They pass, but I'm not sure it they are what are required. If they are, I will finish and make the stack tests.
