# Super Secret Squirrely Insertion Sorts

## Code Challenge 26, by Heather Bisgaard

### Ever had to write a blog post ... and not know how? Welcome to my world.

This is an article about solving the Insertion Sort Code Challenge. In this challenge, we were given a sample array of numbers, pseudo code, and told to show the solution steps in a visual representation, write the code, write passing tests and write a blog article (see headline above). Wish me luck!

I first started by looking at the example. The example showed the same sample array I was given and showed how to trace the array through the iterations of a loop. I used this in my solution. Check out my visual ![here](/javascript/sorts/insertionSort/CC26_insertionSort_whiteboard.png) It shows what each pass of the loop effects on the array, where [i] moved next and which numbers moved.

The next step was to translate the pseudo code into actual code. After tracing through the process in the previous step, I had the pseudo code figured out. I added the language and syntax.

Then I moved on to writing tests. This proved a little difficult, as I was not quite sure what I was supposed to be testing. So I looked back over my code and previous challenges with tests to get a better idea. Then I wrote a test.

This last step will be a never ending step of polishing the products, documentation and submitting. I have a pretty good feeling I need to work on the testing to get it right.

Besides testing, the hardest part of this challenge was writing this blog.
